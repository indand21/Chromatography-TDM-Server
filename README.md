# Chromatography-TDM-Server

The software is intended for Therapeutic drug monitoring centers worldwide. 

We intend to develop this R shiny based program for the following purposes:

1) The ease of calculation of the unknown concentration in the sample evaluated based on the standard. 
2) Reutlisation of once entered the standard concentration, for subsequent calcuation in a swift manner. 
3) Creation of database containing the details of samples evaluated with their results.
4) Maintainence of easily accessable database within the laboratory along with functionality like downloading the database in csv format. 
5) Evaluation of the database for finding out patients in the interested range of concentration. 
6) Interactive analysis of the database to visualise out of range results in seconds. For identifying the samples with out of range results,the date of entry of the results into the database or sample number of the patient is taken as identifiers. 
7) Interpretation of the results of the concentration of the drug obtained based on the drug, age and other clinical criteria. 
8) Making correction's in the concentration of the drug evaluted according to criteria recommended in literature. For e.g., Correction of phenytoin concentration according to albumin concentration.


Developers are welcome from across the world in joining us in devlopemnt of this software further.
