# Chromatography-TDM-Server

The program written on R shiny language is intended for Therapeutic drug monitoring centers worldwide. 

We intended to develop this program for the following purposes:

1) The ease of calculating the unknown concentration of drug in the sample evaluated based on the concentration and spectral value of the standards (Obtained through HPLC,LC-MS/MS or any similar assay methods) instantaneously. 
2) Reutlisation of the once entered the standard concentration into the software for subsequent repeat calculation for finding the unknown concentration of drug in the sample evaluated in a swift manner. 
3) Creation of database containing the details of the samples evaluated with their results.
4) Maintenance of easily accessible database within the laboratory along with functionality like downloading the database in csv format. 
5) Evaluation of the database for finding out patients in the interested range of concentration in a instantaneous manner. 
6) Interactive analysis of the database to visualise out of range results within seconds. For identifying the samples which fall out of range,the date of entry of the results into the database or sample number of the patient will be taken as identifiers by this program. 
7) Interpretation of the results of the concentration of the drug obtained based on the drug, age and other clinical criteria. 
8) Making corrections in the concentration of the drug evaluated according to criteria recommended in literature. An e.g. is, Correction of phenytoin concentration according to blood albumin concentration of the patient.

Developers are welcome from across the world in joining us in further developing this software.
