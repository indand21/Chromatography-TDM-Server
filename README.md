# Chromatography-TDM-Server

The server is intended for the chromatography and Therapeutic drug monitoring centers worldwide. 

We intend to develop this R shiny based program for the following purposes
The ease of calculation of the unknown concentration in the sample evaluated based on the standard. 
Reutlising the standard concentration for subsequent calcuation in a swift manner. 
Creation of database about the patients, samples evaluated along with the results.
Maintainence of easily accessable database in the laboratory with ability to download in csv format. 
Evaluation of the database for finding out patients in the interested range of concentration. 
Analysis of the database in seconds to visualise out of range results based on two criteria namely the date of entry of the results into the database or sample number of the patient
Interpretation of the results of the concentration of the drug obtained based on the drug, age and other clinical criteria. 
Making correction in the concentration of drug evaluted like albumin correction in case of phenytoin and much more. 

Developers are welcome from across the world in joining us in devlopemnt of this software further.
