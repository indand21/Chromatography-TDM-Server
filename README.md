# Shyam's Chromatography-TDM-Server

The program written on R shiny language is intended for Therapeutic drug monitoring centers worldwide. 

We intended to develop this program for the following purposes:

1) The ease of calculating the unknown concentration of drug in the sample evaluated based on the concentration and spectral value of the standards (Obtained through HPLC,LC-MS/MS or any similar assay methods) instantaneously. 
2) Reutlisation of the data for standard concentrations, for multiple samples. 
3) Creation of database containing the details of the samples evaluated with their results.
4) Maintenance of easily accessible database within the laboratory along with functionality like downloading the database in csv format. 
5) Evaluation of the database for finding out patients in the interested range of concentration in a instantaneous manner. In addition,the  the database can be accessed for conducting prospective/retrospective studies
6) Interactive analysis of the database to visualise out of range results within seconds. For identifying the samples which fall out of range,the date of entry of the results into the database or sample number of the patient will be taken as identifiers by this program. 
7) Interpretation of results hence obtained on basis of various parameters like the nature of the drug, patient criteria including age and any significant clinical conditions, drug interaction.
8) Calculation of adjusted concentrations of drug in special conditions as suggested by published literature. An e.g. is, Correction of phenytoin concentration according to blood albumin concentration of the patient.

Developers are welcome from across the world to join us in further developing this software.
